# hypermatix64

A revival of the old Automatix and Ultamatix programs, but compatible with modern \*buntus and more careful about not breaking package management.

This is a work-in-progress program and is currently ONLY compatible with Yakkety Yak. Shouldn't be too hard to port it to other recent versions, though.
